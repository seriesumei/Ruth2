# Ruth2 Scripts

These scripts are used for Ruth2's HUD.

## Ruth2 Only Scripts

ru2_hud_control.lsl - Primary HUD control script

## Common Ruth2/Roth2 Scripts

r2_hud_maker.lsl - Assemble the basic HUD structure and textures

r2_hud_receiver.lsl - Receiver script for body parts

r2_xtea.lsl - Optional encryption module for HUD - body communication

# Versions

The versions of scripts that have specific features tied to the
mesh body releases have been reset to use the form v3.N where N
is simply an increasing number.  The 'v3' comes from Ruth2 v3, when
v4 is releases we will bump all scripts to v4.N.  This allows us to
continue to fix bugs in older scripts and keep the version numbers
sane and identifiable.

Also note that scripts shared with Roth2 that appear in the Roth2
repository will carry a version prefix that matches the Roth release.
